## Objective
Create a simple app that interfaces with any public open API:

1. https://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory  
2. https://rapidapi.com/hub  
3. https://apipheny.io/free-api/  
4. Any public open API you preferred  

The app should utilize an interaction pattern, such as a user input/button, geolocation, etc., to pass information to the API, and with returned data, create content on the page. This is up to you to decide what you want to make here, so do something that you find fun.

Structure your app as you see fit. Connect to the API via $ajax, XMLHttpRequest, axios, or whatever you are most comfortable with. 

Use any Javascript framework, and any structure to your app, but be prepared to justify your selection. 

Please send a public Github repo and live URL of your final work. We recommend Heroku, Github pages, Surge or any other free hosting service.
